# Calculator-Web-App

This is a simple calculator web app I created that allows users to perform basic mathematical calculations. It has a user-friendly interface where users can input numbers and perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator also supports the use of parentheses and percentage calculations!

Key Features:
- Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Support for parentheses to control operator precedence.
- Calculate percentages of numbers.
- Clear input and output.
- Backspace functionality for correcting input.
- Visual formatting of input and output for improved readability.

This project is built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The functionality is implemented using event handling and DOM manipulation techniques.

Feel free to explore, use, and contribute to this app. It can maybe serve as a starting point for building more advanced features.

To get started, simply clone or download the repository and open the files in your IDE. Enjoy calculating!
